## About ❓
This project is designed to make it easier to send emails from your Duck Addresses. It is written entirely in a couple of pages of CSS, JavaScript and HTML. The website has a simple interface. To get help with using the interface, click the red help button at the bottom of the page on the site (this will take you to the wiki).

## Code 👨‍💻
New releases are deployed by a manually run action. When run, the version number will be updated and the updated site deployed on GitHub pages.

All branches are under active development, for latest stable source code go to releases.

## Does the website actually do anything special that I can't do myself? 🤔
No, all it is doing is following the instructions found [here](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/email-protection/duck-addresses/how-do-i-compose-a-new-email/) to create those special addresses.

However, here are some reasons to use the website:

* It makes it easier to send from you duck addresses, so you don’t have to type it out or remember the special pattern.
* You can send an email to multiple people, it would take a long time to do it manually if you are sending to a lot of people.
* You can easily generate private duck addresses straight in the website.
* It looks nice :)

The code is an absolute mess. One day I might make it look nice.
