## About ❓
This project is designed to make it easier to send emails from your Duck Addresses. It is written entirely in a couple of pages of CSS, JavaScript and HTML. The website has a simple interface. To get help with using the interface, click the red help button at the bottom of the page on the site (this will take you to the wiki).

## Code 👨‍💻
This site is hosted using GitHub pages. As soon as a new release is published, it is deployed to GitHub pages.

All branches are under active development, for latest stable source code go to releases.

## Does the website actually do anything special that I can't do myself? 🤔
No, all it is doing is following the instructions found [here](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/email-protection/duck-addresses/how-do-i-compose-a-new-email/) to create those special addresses.

However, here are some reasons to use the website:

* It makes it easier to send from you duck addresses, so you don’t have to type it out or remember the special pattern.
* You can send an email to multiple people, it would take a long time to do it manually if you are sending to a lot of people.
* You can easily generate private duck addresses straight in the website.
* It looks nice :)

> :warning: **Warning!!!** <br>
Despite being a couple of pages of CSS, JavaScript and HTML, the formatting of the code and naming of things is quite a mess!
