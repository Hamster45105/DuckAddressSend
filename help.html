        <button class="accordion-btn">Why is the generate private duck address feature disabled?</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Unfortunately, when trying to contact the DuckDuckGo API directly in the script, a CORS error was coming back and there appeared to be no fix. That means that it has come down to using a CORS proxy service. Initially, the website was using the cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com, however this appears to be rate limited and it no longer works for requests from the website. A good alternative is cors.sh (same thing except more stable). The problem is that this is a paid service UNLESS your project is open sourced AND has at least 5 stars. Until the project can get 5 stars the feature is disabled. When 5 stars is reached, cors.sh will be implemented and the feature re-eneabled. So, to get this feature back up and running, please give the repo a star!</p>
