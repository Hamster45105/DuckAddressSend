      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion-btn">Where can I find the GitHub repo for this project?</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>The GitHub repo for this project is located at: <a href="https://github.com/Hamster45105/DuckAddressSend">this address</a>.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion-btn">How do I get my DDG API Key?</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="spaced-p">To get your API key, go to: <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/generator/#:~:text=Forward%20Email-,duckduckgo,-Log%20in%20to">this page</a>, click on the "DuckDuckGo" button (should be highlighted) in the list (next to Simple Login, AnonAddy etc...) and follow the instructions there.</p>

        <p class="spaced-p">OR, if that doesn't work:</p>

        <p class="spaced-p">Go to: <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/generator/#username-types/">this page</a>, scroll down to "Forwarded email alias", scroll some more until you can click on the "DuckDuckGo" button in the list (next to Simple Login, AnonAddy etc...) and follow the instructions there.</p>

        <button class="accordion-btn">Why is the generate private duck address feature disabled?</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Unfortunately, when trying to contact the DuckDuckGo API directly in the script, a CORS error was coming back and there appeared to be no fix. That means that it has come down to using a CORS proxy service. Initially, the website was using the cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com, however this appears to be rate limited and it no longer works for requests from the website. A good alternative is cors.sh (same thing except more stable). The problem is that this is a paid service UNLESS your project is open sourced AND has at least 5 stars. Until the project can get 5 stars the feature is disabled. When 5 stars is reached, cors.sh will be implemented and the feature re-enabled. So, to get this feature back up and running, please give the repo a star!</p>
